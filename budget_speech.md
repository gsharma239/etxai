## Budget 2025-2026

## Speech of

## Nirmala Sitharaman Minister of Finance

## February 1, 2025

Hon'ble Speaker,

I present the Budget for 2025-26.

## Introduction

- 1. This Budget continues our Government 's efforts to:
- a) accelerate growth,
- b) secure inclusive development,
- c) invigorate private sector investments,
- d) uplift household sentiments, and
- e) enhance spending power of India's rising middle class.
- 2. Together, we embark on a journey to unlock our nation's tremendous potential for greater prosperity and global positioning under the leadership of Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.
- 3. As  we  complete  the  first  quarter  of  the  21 st century,  continuing geopolitical  headwinds  suggest  lower  global  economic  growth  over  the medium term. However, our aspiration for a Viksit Bharat inspires us, and the transformative work we have done during our Government 's first two terms guides us, to march forward resolutely.

## Budget Theme

- 4. Our economy is the fastest-growing among all major global economies. Our development track record of the past 10 years and structural reforms have drawn global attention. Confidence in India's capability and potential has only

grown in this period. We see the next five years as a unique opportunity to realize 'Sabka Vikas', stimulating balanced growth of all regions.

- 5. The  great  Telugu  poet  and  playwright  Gurajada  Appa  Rao  had  said, ' Desamante Matti Kaadoi, Desamante Manushuloi '; meaning, 'A country is not just  its  soil,  a  country  is  its  people.'  In  line  with  this,  for  us,  Viksit  Bharat, encompasses:
- a) zero-poverty;
- b) hundred per cent good quality school education;
- c) access to high-quality, affordable, and comprehensive healthcare;
- d) hundred per cent skilled labour with meaningful employment;
- e) seventy per cent women in economic activities; and
- f) farmers making our country the 'food basket of the world'.
- 6. In  this  Budget,  the  proposed development measures span ten broad areas focusing on Garib, Youth, Annadata and Nari.
- 1) Spurring Agricultural Growth and Productivity;
- 2) Building Rural Prosperity and Resilience;
- 3) Taking Everyone Together on an Inclusive Growth path;
- 4) Boosting Manufacturing and Furthering Make in India;
- 5) Supporting MSMEs;
- 6) Enabling Employment-led Development;
- 7) Investing in people, economy and innovation;
- 8) Securing Energy Supplies;
- 9) Promoting Exports; and
- 10) Nurturing Innovation.
- 7. For this journey of development,
- a) Our four powerful engines are: Agriculture, MSME, Investment, and Exports
- b) The fuel: our Reforms
- c) Our guiding spirit: Inclusivity
- d) And the destination: Viksit Bharat

- 8. This Budget aims to initiate transformative reforms across six domains. During the next five years, these will augment our growth potential and global competitiveness. The domains are:
- 1) Taxation;
- 2) Power Sector;
- 3) Urban Development;
- 4) Mining;
- 5) Financial Sector; and
- 6) Regulatory Reforms.

## Agriculture as the 1 st Engine

- 9. Now I move to specific proposals, beginning with 'Agriculture as the 1 st Engine'.

## Prime  Minister  Dhan-Dhaanya  Krishi  Yojana  -  Developing  Agri  Districts Programme

- 10. Motivated by the success of the Aspirational Districts Programme, our Government will undertake a 'Prime Minister Dhan -Dhaanya Krishi Yojana ' in partnership  with  states.  Through  the  convergence  of  existing  schemes  and specialized  measures,  the  programme  will  cover  100  districts  with  low productivity, moderate crop intensity and below-average credit parameters. It aims to (1) enhance agricultural productivity, (2) adopt crop diversification and sustainable  agriculture  practices,  (3)  augment  post-harvest  storage  at  the panchayat  and  block  level,  (4)  improve  irrigation  facilities,  and  (5)  facilitate availability of long-term and short-term credit. This programme is likely to help 1.7 crore farmers.

## Building Rural Prosperity and Resilience

- 11. A comprehensive  multisectoral 'Rural Prosperity and  Resilience' programme will be launched in partnership with states. This will address underemployment  in  agriculture  through  skilling,  investment,  technology,  and invigorating the rural economy. The goal is to generate ample opportunities in rural areas so that migration is an option, but not a necessity.
- 12. The programme will focus on rural women, young farmers, rural youth, marginal and small farmers, and landless families. Details are in Annexure A.

- 13. Global and domestic best practices will be incorporated and appropriate technical and financial assistance will be sought from multilateral development banks. In Phase-1, 100 developing agri-districts will be covered.

## Aatmanirbharta in Pulses

- 14. Our  Government  is  implementing  the  National  Mission  for  Edible Oilseed  for  achieving  atmanirbhrata  in  edible  oils.  Our  farmers  have  the capability to grow enough for our needs and more.
- 15. Ten years ago, we made concerted efforts and succeeded in achieving near self-sufficiency in pulses. Farmers responded to the need by increasing the cultivated area by 50 per cent and Government arranged for procurement and remunerative prices. Since then, with rising incomes and better affordability, our consumption of pulses has increased significantly.
- 16. Our Government will now launch a 6year 'Mission for Aatmanirbharta in  Pulses'  with  a  special  focus  on  Tur,  Urad  and  Masoor.    Details  are  in Annexure B. Central agencies (NAFED and NCCF) will be ready to procure these 3 pulses, as much as offered during the next 4 years from farmers who register with these agencies and enter into agreements.

## Comprehensive Programme for Vegetables &amp; Fruits

- 17. It  is  encouraging that our people are increasingly becoming aware of their nutritional needs. It is a sign of a society becoming healthier. With rising income  levels,  the  consumption  of  vegetables,  fruits  and  shree-anna  is increasing significantly. A comprehensive programme to promote production, efficient  supplies,  processing,  and  remunerative  prices  for  farmers  will  be launched in partnership with states. Appropriate institutional mechanisms for implementation  and  participation  of  farmer  producer  organizations  and cooperatives will be set up.

## Makhana Board in Bihar

- 18. For  this,  there  is  a  special  opportunity  for  the  people  of  Bihar.  A Makhana  Board  will  be  established  in  the  state  to  improve  production, processing, value addition, and marketing of makhana. The people engaged in these activities will be organized into FPOs. The Board will provide handholding and training support to makhana farmers and will also work to ensure they receive the benefits of all relevant Government schemes.

## National Mission on High Yielding Seeds

- 19. A National Mission on High Yielding Seeds will be launched, aimed at (1) strengthening the research ecosystem, (2) targeted development and propagation of seeds with high yield, pest resistance and climate resilience, and (3) commercial availability of more than 100 seed varieties released since July 2024.

## Fisheries

- 20. India ranks second-largest globally in fish production and aquaculture. Seafood exports are valued at ` 60 thousand crore. To unlock the untapped potential  of  the  marine  sector,  our  Government  will  bring  in  an  enabling framework  for  sustainable  harnessing  of  fisheries  from  Indian  Exclusive Economic Zone and High Seas, with a special focus on the Andaman &amp; Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands.

## Mission for Cotton Productivity

- 21. For  the  benefit  of  lakhs  of  cotton  growing  farmers,  I  am  pleased  to announce a 'Mission for Cotton Productivity'. This 5 -year mission will facilitate significant improvements in productivity and sustainability of cotton farming, and  promote  extra-long  staple  cotton  varieties.  The  best  of  science  &amp; technology support will be provided to farmers. Aligned with our integrated 5F vision for the textile sector, this will help in increasing incomes of the farmers, and ensure a steady supply of quality cotton for r ejuvenating India's traditional textile sector.

## Enhanced Credit through KCC

- 22. Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) facilitate short term loans for 7.7 crore farmers, fishermen,  and  dairy  farmers.  The  loan  limit  under  the  Modified  Interest Subvention Scheme will be enhanced from ` 3 lakh to 5 lakh for loans taken through the KCC.

## Urea Plant in Assam

- 23. For Atmanirbharta in urea production, our Government had reopened three  dormant  urea  plants  in  the  Eastern  region.  To  further  augment  urea supply, a plant with annual capacity of 12.7 lakh metric tons will be set up at Namrup, Assam.

## India Post as a Catalyst for the Rural Economy

- 24. India Post with 1.5 lakh rural post offices, complemented by the India Post  Payment  Bank  and  a  vast  network  of  2.4  lakh  Dak  Sevaks,  will  be repositioned  to  act  as  a  catalyst  for  the  rural  economy.  Details  are  at Annexure C.

- 25. India Post will also be transformed as a large public logistics organization. This will meet the rising needs of Viswakarmas, new entrepreneurs, women, self-help groups, MSMEs, and large business organizations.

## Support to NCDC

- 26. Our Government will provide support to NCDC for its lending operations for the cooperative sector.

## MSMEs as the 2 nd  engine

- 27. Now,  I  move  to  MSMEs  as  the  2 nd engine,  which  encompasses manufacturing and services with a focus on MSMEs numbering 5.7 crore.

## Revision in classification criteria for MSMEs

- 28. Currently, over 1 crore registered MSMEs, employing 7.5 crore people, and  generating  36  per  cent  of  our  manufacturing,  have  come  together  to position  India  as  a  global  manufacturing  hub.  With  their  quality  products, these MSMEs are responsible for 45 per cent of our exports. To help them achieve  higher  efficiencies  of  scale,  technological  upgradation  and  better access to capital, the investment and turnover limits for classification  of all MSMEs will be enhanced to 2.5 and 2 times respectively. This will give them the confidence to grow and generate employment for our youth. The details are in Annexure D.

## Significant enhancement of credit availability with guarantee cover

- 29. To  improve  access  to  credit,  the  credit  guarantee  cover  will  be enhanced :
- a) For Micro and Small Enterprises, from   5 crore to 10 crore, leading ` to additional credit of ` 1.5 lakh crore in the next 5 years;
- b) For Startups, from ` 10 crore to 20 crore, with the guarantee fee being  moderated  to  1  per  cent  for  loans  in  27  focus  sectors important for Atmanirbhar Bharat; and
- c) For well-run exporter MSMEs, for term loans up to ` 20 crore.

## Credit Cards for Micro Enterprises

- 30. We will introduce customized Credit Cards with a   5 lakh limit for micro ` enterprises registered on Udyam portal. In the first year, 10 lakh such cards will be issued.

## Fund of Funds for Startups

- 31. The  Alternate  Investment  Funds  (AIFs)  for  startups  have  received commitments of more than ` 91,000 crore. These are supported by the Fund of Funds set up with a Government contribution of   10,000 crore. Now, a new ` Fund  of  Funds,  with  expanded  scope  and  a  fresh  contribution  of  another ` 10,000 crore will be set up.

## Scheme for First-time Entrepreneurs

- 32. A new scheme will be launched for 5 lakh women, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled  Tribes  first-time  entrepreneurs.  This  will  provide  term  loans  up to ` 2 crore during the next 5 years. The scheme will incorporate lessons from the successful Stand-Up India scheme. Online capacity building for entrepreneurship and managerial skills will also be organized.

## Measures for Labour-Intensive Sectors

- 33. To promote  employment  and  entrepreneurship opportunities in labour-intensive  sectors,  our  Government will  undertake  specific  policy  and facilitation measures.

## Focus Product Scheme for Footwear &amp; Leather Sectors

- 34. To  enhance  the  productivity,  quality  and  competitiveness of  India's footwear and leather sector, a focus product scheme will be implemented. The scheme will support design capacity, component manufacturing, and machinery required for production of non-leather quality footwear, besides the support for leather footwear and products. The scheme is expected to facilitate employment  for  22  lakh  persons,  generate  turnover  of ` 4  lakh  crore  and exports of over ` 1.1 lakh crore.

## Measures for the Toy Sector

- 35. Building  on  the  National  Action  Plan  for  Toys,  we  will  implement  a scheme  to  make  India  a  global  hub  for  toys.  The  scheme  will  focus  on development of clusters, skills, and a manufacturing ecosystem that will create high-quality, unique, innovative, and sustainable toys that will represent the 'Made in India' brand.

## Support for Food Processing

- 36. In line with our commitment towards 'Purvodaya', we will establish a National Institute of Food Technology, Entrepreneurship and Management in Bihar. The institute will provide a strong fillip to food processing activities in

the  entire  Eastern  region.  This  will  result  in  (1)  enhanced  income  for  the farmers through value addition to their produce, and (2) skilling, entrepreneurship and employment opportunities for the youth.

## Manufacturing Mission Furthering 'Make in India'

- 37. Our Government will set up a National Manufacturing Mission covering small, medium and large industries for furthering 'Make in India' by providing policy support, execution roadmaps, governance and monitoring framework for central ministries and states. Details are in Annexure E.

Continuing  these  efforts, I reaffirm the commitment of the tax department to 'trust first, scrutinize later'. I also propose to introduce the new income-tax bill next week. I will detail the indirect tax reforms and changes in direct taxes in Part B.

## Financial Sector Reforms and Development

## FDI in Insurance Sector

- 95. The FDI limit for the insurance sector will be raised from 74 to 100 per cent. This enhanced limit will be available for those companies which invest the entire premium in India. The current guardrails and conditionalities associated with foreign investment will be reviewed and simplified.

## Expanding Services of India Post Payment Bank

- 96. The  services  of  India  Post  Payment  Bank  will  be  deepened  and expanded in rural areas.

## Credit Enhancement Facility by NaBFID

- 97. NaBFID will set up a 'Partial Credit Enhancement Facility' for corporate bonds for infrastructure.

## Grameen Credit Score

- 98. Public Sector Banks will develop 'Grameen Credit Score' framework to serve the credit needs of SHG members and people in rural areas.

## Pension Sector

- 99. A  forum  for  regulatory  coordination  and  development  of  pension products will be set up.

## KYC Simplification

- 100. To  implement  the  earlier  announcement  on  simplifying  the  KYC process, the revamped Central KYC Registry will be rolled out in 2025. We will also implement a streamlined system for periodic updating.

## Merger of Companies

- 101. Requirements and procedures for speedy approval of company mergers will be rationalized. The scope for fast-track mergers will also be widened and the process made simpler.

## Bilateral Investment Treaties

- 102. As  proposed  in  the  Interim  Budget,  we  signed  Bilateral  Investment Treaties  (BIT)  with  two  countries  in  2024.  To  encourage  sustained  foreign investment and in the spirit of 'first develop India', the current model BIT will be revamped and made more investor-friendly.

## Regulatory Reforms

103. In  the  last  ten  years  in  several  aspects,  including  financial  and  nonfinancial, our Government has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to 'Ease of  Doing Business'. We are determined to ensure that our regulations must keep  up  with  technological  innovations  and  global  policy  developments.  A light-touch  regulatory  framework  based on principles  and trust  will  unleash productivity  and  employment.  Through  this  framework,  we  will  update regulations that were made under old laws. To develop this modern, flexible, people-friendly,  and  trust-based  regulatory  framework  appropriate  for  the twenty-first century, I propose four specific measures:

## High Level Committee for Regulatory Reforms

- 104. A  High-Level  Committee  for  Regulatory  Reforms will  be  set  up  for  a review  of  all  non-financial  sector  regulations,  certifications,  licenses,  and permissions. The committee will be expected make recommendations within a

year. The objective is to strengthen trust-based economic governance and take transformational measures to enhance 'ease of doing business', especially in matters of inspections and compliances.  States will be encouraged to join in this endeavour.

## Investment Friendliness Index of States

- 105. An Investment Friendliness Index of States will be launched in 2025 to further the spirit of competitive cooperative federalism.

## FSDC Mechanism

106. Under the Financial Stability and Development Council, a mechanism will  be  set  up  to  evaluate  impact  of  the  current  financial  regulations  and subsidiary  instructions.  It  will  also  formulate  a  framework  to  enhance  their responsiveness and development of the financial sector.

## Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0

- 107. In  the  Jan  Vishwas  Act  2023,  more  than  180  legal  provisions  were decriminalized. Our Government will now bring up the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 to decriminalize more than 100 provisions in various laws.

## Fiscal Policy

108. Now I move to fiscal policy matters.

## Fiscal Consolidation

- 109. In  the  July  Budget,  I  had  committed  to  staying  the  course  for  fiscal consolidation. Our endeavour will be to keep the fiscal deficit each year such that the Central Government debt remains on a declining path as a percentage of the GDP. The roadmap for the next 6 years has been detailed in the FRBM statement.

## Revised Estimates 2024-25

- 110. The  Revised  Estimate  of  the  total  receipts  other  than  borrowings  is ` 31.47 lakh crore, of which the net tax receipts are ` 25.57 lakh crore. The Revised Estimate of the total expenditure is ` 47.16 lakh crore, of which the capital expenditure is about ` 10.18 lakh crore.
- 111. The Revised Estimate of the fiscal deficit is 4.8 per cent of GDP.

## Budget Estimates 2025-26

- 112. Coming to 2025-26, the total receipts other than borrowings and the total expenditure are estimated at ` 34.96 lakh crore and ` 50.65 lakh crore respectively. The net tax receipts are estimated at ` 28.37 lakh crore.
- 113. The fiscal deficit is estimated to be 4.4 per cent of GDP.
- 114. To  finance  the  fiscal  deficit,  the  net  market  borrowings  from  dated securities are estimated at   11.54 lakh crore. The balance financing is expected ` to come from small savings and other sources. The gross market borrowings are estimated at ` 14.82 lakh crore.

I will now move to Part B.

## PART B

## Indirect Taxes

- 115. My proposals relating to Customs aim to rationalize tariff structure and address duty inversion. These will also support domestic manufacturing and value addition, promote exports, facilitate trade and provide relief to common people.

## Rationalisation of Customs Tariff Structure for Industrial Goods

- 116. As a part of comprehensive  review  of Customs  rate structure announced in July 2024 Budget, I propose to:
- (i) remove seven tariff rates. This is over and above the seven tariff rates removed in 2023-24 budget. After this, there will be only eight remaining tariff rates including 'zero' rate.
- (ii) apply appropriate cess to broadly maintain effective duty incidence except on a few items, where such incidence will reduce marginally.
- (iii) levy not more than one cess or surcharge. Therefore, I propose to exempt Social Welfare Surcharge on 82 tariff lines that are subject to a cess.
- 117. I shall now take up sector specific proposals.

## Relief on import of Drugs/Medicines

- 118. To provide relief to patients, particularly those suffering from cancer, rare diseases and other severe chronic diseases, I propose to add 36 lifesaving drugs and medicines to the list of medicines fully exempted from Basic Customs Duty (BCD).  I also propose to add 6 lifesaving medicines to the list attracting concessional customs duty of 5%. Full exemption and concessional duty will also respectively apply on the bulk drugs for manufacture of the above.
- 119. Specified drugs and medicines under Patient Assistance Programmes run by pharmaceutical companies are fully exempt from BCD, provided the medicines  are  supplied  free  of  cost  to  patients.  I  propose  to  add  37  more medicines along with 13 new patient assistance programmes.

## Support to Domestic Manufacturing and Value addition

## Critical Minerals

120. In the July 2024 Budget, I had fully exempted BCD on 25 critical minerals that are not domestically available. I had also reduced BCD of 2 other such minerals to provide a major fillip to their processing especially by MSMEs. Now, I  propose to fully exempt cobalt powder and waste, the scrap of lithium-ion battery, Lead, Zinc and 12 more critical minerals. This will help secure their availability for manufacturing in India and promote more jobs for our youth.

## Textiles

121. To promote domestic production of technical textile products such as agro-textiles, medical textiles and geo textiles at competitive prices, I propose to add two more types of shuttle-less looms to the list of fully exempted textile machinery.  I also propose to revise the BCD rate on knitted fabrics covered by nine  tariff  lines  from  '10%  or  20%'  to  '20%  or ` 115  per  kg,  whichever  is higher'.

## Electronic Goods

- 122. In  line  with  our  'Make  in  India'  policy,  and  to  rectify  inverted  duty structure, I propose to increase the BCD on Interactive Flat Panel Display (IFPD) from  10%  to  20%  and  reduce  the  BCD  to  5%  on  Open  Cell  and  other components.
- 123. In 2023 -24 Budget, for the manufacture of Open Cells of LCD/LED TVs, I had reduced the BCD on parts of Open Cells from 5% to 2.5% . To further boost the manufacture of such Open Cells, the BCD on these parts will now stand exempted.

## Lithium Ion Battery

- 124. To the list of exempted capital goods, I propose to add 35 additional capital goods for EV battery manufacturing, and 28 additional capital goods for mobile phone battery manufacturing. This will boost domestic manufacture of lithium-ion battery, both for mobile phones and electric vehicles.

## Shipping Sector

- 125. Considering that shipbuilding has a long gestation period, I propose to continue the exemption of BCD on raw materials, components, consumables or parts for the manufacture of ships for another ten years. I also propose the same dispensation for ship breaking to make it more competitive.

## Telecommunication

126. To prevent classification disputes, I propose to reduce the BCD from 20% to 10% on Carrier Grade ethernet switches to make it at par with NonCarrier Grade ethernet switches.

## Export Promotion

## Handicraft Goods

- 127. To facilitate exports of handicrafts, I propose to extend the time period for export from six months to one year, further extendable by another three months, if required. I also propose to add nine items to the list of duty-free inputs.

## Leather sector

- 128. I propose to fully exempt BCD on Wet Blue leather to facilitate imports for domestic value addition and employment. I also propose to exempt crust leather from 20% export duty to facilitate exports by small tanners.

## Marine products

- 129. To  enhance  India's  competitiveness  in  the  global  seafood  market,  I propose  to  reduce  BCD  from  30%  to  5%  on Frozen  Fish  Paste  (Surimi)  for manufacture and export of its analogue products. I also propose to reduce BCD from 15% to 5% on fish hydrolysate for manufacture of fish and   shrimp feeds.

## Domestic MROs for Railway Goods

- 130. In July 2024 Budget, to promote development of domestic MROs for aircraft and ships, I had extended the time limit for export of foreign origin goods that were imported for repairs, from 6 months to one year and further extendable by one year.  I now propose to extend the same dispensation for railway goods.

## Trade facilitation

## Time limit for Provisional Assessment

- 131. Presently, the Customs Act, 1962 does not provide any time limit to finalize Provisional Assessments leading to uncertainty and cost to trade. As a measure of promoting ease of doing business, I propose to fix a time-limit of two years, extendable by a year, for finalising the provisional assessment.

## Voluntary Compliance

- 132. I propose to introduce a new provision that will enable importers or exporters, after clearance of goods, to voluntarily declare material facts and pay  duty  with  interest  but  without  penalty.  This  will  incentivise  voluntary compliance.    However,  this  will  not  apply  in  cases  where  department  has already initiated audit or investigation proceedings.

## Extended Time for End Use

- 133. For industry to better plan their imports, I propose to extend the time limit for the end-use of imported inputs in the relevant rules, from six months to  one  year.  This  will  provide  operational  flexibility  in  view  of  cost  and uncertainty  of  supply.  Further,  such  importers  will  now  have  to  file  only quarterly statements instead of a monthly statement.

## Direct Taxes

I now come to my Direct tax proposals.

- 134. In  Part  A,  I  have  briefly  underlined  Taxation  Reforms  as  one  of  key reforms to realize our vision of Viksit Bharat.  In respect of criminal law, Our Government  had  earlier  ushered  in  Bharatiya  Nyaya  Sanhita  replacing Bharatiya  Danda  Sanhita.  I  am  happy  to  inform  this  August  House  and  the country  that  the  new  income-tax  bill  will  carry  forward  the  same  spirit  of 'Nyaya'. The new bill will be clear and direct in text with close to half of the present  law,  in  terms  of  both  chapters  and  words.  It  will  be  simple  to understand for taxpayers and tax administration, leading to tax certainty and reduced litigation.
- 135. Reforms, however, are not a destination. They are a means to achieve good governance for our people and economy. Providing good governance primarily involves being responsive. The Thirukkural captures this in Verse 542, which reads:

வான ாக்கி வாழும் உலககல்லாம் ம ் வ ் னகால்ன ாக்கி வாழு ங் குடி .

vaanokki vaalum ulakellaam mannavan koalnokki vaalung kuti

Meaning:

Just as living beings live expecting rains,

Citizens live expecting good governance.

Our Government is committed to keeping an ear to the ground and a finger on the  pulse,  and  responding  while  balancing  our  nation-building  efforts.  The following measures will detail just how our Government under the guidance of PM Modi has taken steps to understand and address the needs voiced by our citizens. My tax proposals are guided by this spirit.

- 136. The objectives of my proposals are as follows:
- (i) Personal Income Tax reforms with special focus on middle class
- (ii) Rationalization of TDS/TCS for easing difficulties
- (iii) Encouraging voluntary compliance
- (iv) Reducing compliance burden
- (v) Ease of doing business
- (vi) Employment and investment

I will come to my proposal on personal income tax towards the end.

## TDS/TCS rationalization for easing difficulties

- 137. I propose to rationalize Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) by reducing the number  of  rates  and  thresholds  above  which  TDS  is  deducted.  Further, threshold amounts for tax deduction will be increased for better clarity and uniformity. The limit for tax deduction on interest for senior citizens is being doubled from the present ` 50,000 to ` 1 lakh. Similarly, the annual limit of ` 2.40 lakh for TDS on rent is being increased to ` 6 lakh. This will reduce the number  of  transactions  liable  to  TDS,  thus  benefitting  small  tax  payers receiving small payments.
- 138. The threshold to collect tax at source (TCS) on remittances under RBI's Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) is proposed to be increased from   7 lakh ` to ` 10  lakh.  I  also  propose  to  remove  TCS  on  remittances  for  education purposes,  where  such  remittance  is  out  of  a  loan  taken  from  a  specified financial institution.
- 139. Both TDS and TCS are being applied on any transaction relating to sale of goods. To prevent such compliance difficulties, I propose to omit the TCS. I also propose that the provisions of the higher TDS deduction will now apply only in non-PAN cases.

- 140. In July 2024, the delay for payment of TDS up to the due date of filing statement was decriminalized. I propose to provide the same relaxation to TCS provisions as well.

## Encouraging Voluntary Compliance

- 141. The Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi believes in 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas and Sabka Prayas'. In line with this, we brought in updated return facility in 2022 for voluntary compliance by taxpayers  who  had  omitted  to  report  their  correct  income.  Our  trust  in taxpayers was proved right. Nearly 90 lakh taxpayers voluntarily updated their incomes by paying additional tax. Taking this trust further, I now propose to extend the time-limit to file updated returns for any assessment year, from the current limit of two years, to four years.

## Reducing Compliance Burden

- 142. I propose  to  reduce  the  compliance  burden  for  small  charitable trusts/institutions by increasing their period of registration from 5 years to 10 years. It is also proposed that disproportionate consequences do not arise for minor defaults, such as incomplete applications filed by charitable entities.
- 143. Presently  tax-payers  can  claim  the  annual  value  of  self-occupied properties as nil only on the fulfilment of certain conditions. Considering the difficulties faced by taxpayers, it is proposed to allow the benefit of two such self-occupied properties without any condition.

## Ease of Doing Business

- 144. To  streamline  the  process  of  transfer  pricing  and  to  provide  an alternative  to  yearly  examination,  I  propose  to  introduce  a  scheme  for determining arm's length price of international transaction for a block period of three years. This will be in line with global best practices.
- 145. With a view to reduce litigation and provide certainty in international taxation, the scope of safe harbour rules is being expanded.
- 146. A  number  of  senior  and  very  senior  citizens  have  very  old  National Savings Scheme accounts. As interest is no longer payable on such accounts, I propose to exempt withdrawals made from NSS by individuals on or after the 29th of August, 2024. I am also proposing to allow similar treatment to NPS Vatsalya accounts as is available to normal NPS accounts, subject to overall limits.

- 147. In my speech in July 2024, I had promised that all processes including giving effect to appellate orders shall be digitalized and made paper-less over the next two years. I am happy to announce that digitalization is being made operational.
- 148. In July 2024, we brought in the Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme to resolve income  tax  disputes  pending  in  appeal.  The  scheme  has  received  a  great response, with nearly 33,000 tax payers having availed of this scheme to settle their disputes.

## Employment and Investment

- 149. I have a few proposals to promote investment and employment.

## Tax certainty for electronics manufacturing Schemes

- 150. It  is  proposed  to  provide  a  presumptive  taxation  regime  for  nonresidents who provide services to a resident company that is establishing or operating an electronics manufacturing facility. I further propose to introduce a safe harbour for tax certainty for non-residents who store components for supply to specified electronics manufacturing units.

## Tonnage Tax Scheme for Inland Vessels

- 151. Presently the tonnage tax scheme is available to only sea going ships. The benefits of existing tonnage tax scheme are proposed to be extended to inland vessels registered under the Indian Vessels Act, 2021 to promote inland water transport in the country.

## Extension for incorporation of Start-Ups

- 152. We continue to support the Indian start-up eco-system. I propose to extend the period of incorporation by 5 years to allow the benefit available to start-ups which are incorporated before 1.4.2030.

## International Financial Services Centre (IFSC)

- 153. In order to attract and promote additional activities in the IFSC, I am inter alia proposing specific benefits to ship-leasing units, insurance offices and treasury centres of global companies which are set up in IFSC.  Further, to claim benefits, the cut-off date for commencement in IFSC has also been extended by five years to 31.3.2030.

## Alternate Investment Funds (AIFs)

- 154. Category  I  and  category  II  AIFs  are undertaking  investments  in infrastructure  and  other  such  sectors.  I  propose  to  provide  certainty  of taxation to these entities on the gains from securities.

## Extension of investment date for Sovereign and Pension Funds

- 155. To promote funding from Sovereign Wealth Funds and Pension Funds to  the  infrastructure  sector,  I  propose  to  extend  the  date  of  making  an investment by five more years, to 31 st March, 2030.

## Personal Income- tax Reforms with special focus on middle class

156. Democracy, Demography and Demand are the key support pillars in our journey towards Viksit Bharat. The middle class provides strength for India's growth. This Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi has always  believed  in  the  admirable  energy  and  ability  of  the  middle  class  in nation  building.  In  recognition  of  their  contribution,  we  have  periodically reduced their  tax  burden.  Right  after  2014,  the  'Nil  tax'  slab  was  raised  to ` 2.5 lakh, which was further raised to ` 5 lakh in 2019 and to ` 7 lakh in 2023. This is reflective of our Government 's trust on the middle-class tax payers. I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable upto income of ` 12 lakh (i.e. average income of ` 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be ` 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of ` 75,000.

- 157. Slabs and rates are being changed across the board to benefit all taxpayers. The new structure will substantially reduce the taxes of the middle class and leave more money in their hands, boosting household consumption, savings and investment.
- 158. In the new tax regime, I propose to revise tax rate structure as follows:

| 0-4 lakh rupees      | Nil         |
| 4-8 lakh rupees      | 5 per cent  |
| 8-12 lakh rupees     | 10 per cent |
| 12-16 lakh rupees    | 15 per cent |
| 16-20 lakh rupees    | 20 per cent |
| 20- 24 lakh rupees   | 25 per cent |
| Above 24 lakh rupees | 30 per cent |

- 159. To tax payers upto ` 12 lakh of normal income (other than special rate income such as capital gains) tax rebate is being provided in addition to the benefit due to slab rate reduction in such a manner that there is no tax payable by them. The total tax benefit of slab rate changes and rebate at different income levels can be illustrated with examples. A tax payer in the new regime with an income of ` 12 lakh will get a benefit of ` 80,000 in tax (which is 100% of tax payable as per existing rates). A person having income of ` 18 lakh will get  a  benefit  of ` 70,000  in  tax  (30%  of  tax  payable  as  per  existing  rates). A person with an income of ` 25 lakh gets a benefit of ` 1,10,000 (25% of his tax payable as per existing rates).
- 160. Details of my tax proposals are given in the Annexure.
- 161. As a result of these proposals, revenue of about ₹ 1 lakh crore in direct taxes and ₹ 2600 crore in indirect taxes will be forgone.

Mr. Speaker Sir, with this, I commend the budget to this august House. Jai Hind.

## 2. Rebate on income-tax

- · Resident individual with total income up to   7,00,000 do not pay any ` tax  due  to  rebate  under  the  new  tax  regime.  It  is  proposed  to increase the rebate for the resident individual under the new regime so that they do not pay tax if their total income is up to ` 12,00,000. Marginal relief as provided earlier under the new tax regime is also applicable for income marginally higher than ` 12,00,000.
- · A few examples for calculation of tax benefit are given in the table below:
